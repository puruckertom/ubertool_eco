<p>
The &#252;tool is a cloud-based web application platform that includes a variety of aquatic, terrestrial and
atmospheric deposition fate and transport models used by the EPA for the ecological risk assessment of pesticides.
The science models in the &#252;tool provide predictions concerning chemical concentrations in environmental media,
exposure doses, tissue residues and ultimately predictions of effects. These predictions are relevant for a number of
ecological species under regulations that the EPA is responsible for, including the registration of pesticides and the
protection of endangered species.

<h2>Models in the &#252;tool</h2>
<h3>Terrestrial Models</h3>
<p>
Terrestrial models estimate exposure concentrations in terrestrial media and screen for pesticide effects at
different trophic levels.
<ul>
<li>TerrPlant provides screening level estimates of exposure to terrestrial plants from single pesticide applications through runoff or drift.
<li>Screening Imbibition Program (SIP) estimates chemical exposure from drinking water in birds and mammals.
<li>Screening Tool for Inhalation Risk (STIR) estimates inhalation risk of chemicals to birds and mammals.
<li>Terrestrial Residue Exposure (T-REX) calculates residues on avian and mammalian food items, like grass, seeds and insects, along with the dissipation rate of a chemical applied to foliar surfaces to estimate acute and reproductive risk quotients.
<li>Terrestrial Herpetofaunal Exposure Residue Program Simulation (T-HERPS) estimates dietary exposure and risk to terrestrial-phase amphibians and reptiles from pesticide use.
<li>Individual Effect Change Model (IEC) estimates potential effects at an individual level.
<li>AgDrift calculates the downward drift and deposition of pesticides and the magnitude of buffer zones needed to protect sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
<li>Earthworm estimates pesticide concentrations in earthworms to show potential exposure to pesticides in mammals that consume earthworms.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Aquatic Models</h3>
<p>
Aquatic species have a different set of models that can provide exposure concentrations in relevant water bodies,
estimate exposures and screen for effects in fish, aquatic invertebrates, piscivorous birds and mammals.
<ul>
<li> RICE estimates surface water exposure from pesticide use in rice paddies.
<li> Kow (based) Aquatic BioAccumulation Model (KABAM) links hydrophobic organic pesticide bioaccumulation in aquatic
components of a food web to terrestrial exposure in birds and mammals. It has both a bioaccumulation model and a
terrestrial risk component.
<li>Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) simulates the magnitude, duration and location of aquatic exposure concentrations of
pesticides.
