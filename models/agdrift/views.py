description = '<p>The primary function of AgDRIFT is to calculate the downward ' \
              'drift and deposition of pesticides and the magnitude of buffer ' \
              'zones needed to protect sensitive aquatic and terrestrial habitats. ' \
              'The Tier I model methodology uses different application type and drop ' \
              'size distributions to yield a conservative exposure estimate. Application ' \
              'type options in AgDRIFT include aerial, ground, and orchard/airblast. ' \
              'The aerial application model of spray drift is based on both mechanistic ' \
              'models and field data. The model outputs for ground and orchard/airblast ' \
              'models are based solely on field data. </p>'
