<p>The total dose of individual bees (ug a.i./bee) is calculated using EEC calculations and consumption rates of
individual bees. In the instance when empirical EEC data is provided, the empirical EEC data is used to calculate total
dose of individual bees. Consumption rates of pollen and nectar (mg/day) are derived from Appendix 3, Table 2 of the
2014 Guidance for Assessing Pesticide Risks to Bees document:</p>
