<p>The Bee-REX model is a screening level tool that is intended for use in a Tier I risk assessment to assess exposures
of bees to pesticides and to calculate risk quotients. This model is individual-based, and is not intended to assess
exposures and effects at the colony-level (<i>i.e.,</i> for honeybees).
<n></n>
The Tier I exposure method is intended to account for the major routes of pesticide exposure that are relevant to bees
(<i>i.e.,</i> through diet and contact). Exposure routes for bees differ based on application type. In the model, bees
foraging in fields treated with a pesticide through foliar spray could potentially be exposed to the pesticide through
direct spray as well through consuming contaminated food. For honeybees foraging in fields treated with a pesticide
through direct application to soil (<i>e.g.,</i> drip irrigation), through seed treatments, or through tree injection,
direct spray onto bees is not expected. For these application methods, pesticide exposure through consumption of
residues in nectar and pollen are expected to be the dominant routes. Foraging honeybees may also be exposed to
pesticides via contact with dust from seed treatments or via consumption of water from surface water, puddles, dew
droplet formation on leaves and guttation fluid; however, the Bee-REX tool does not include quantification of exposures
via these routes.
