description = '<p>Earthworm Fugacity Modeling is a simple fugacity approach was employed ' \
              'to estimate pesticides concentrations in earthworms. Fugacity is most often r' \
              'egarded as the "escaping tendency" of a chemical from a particular phase. ' \
              'Fugacity has units of presure, generally pascals (Pa), and can be related ' \

              '<p>The T-REX model (USEPA 2008) is useful for assessing exposures of ' \
              'terrestrial animals to pesticide residues on foliar surfaces of crops ' \
              'and seeds. The model cannot be used to assess pesticide exposures to ' \
              'terrestrial animals resulting from consumption of earthworms contaminated ' \
              'with pesticide mass present in the soil of the application site. In order ' \
              'to explore the potential exposures of mammals to pesticides present in the ' \
              'soil and earthworms present on the treatment site, a simple fugacity approach ' \
              'was employed to estimate pesticides concentrations in earthworms. </p>'
