description = '<p>The Tier I Rice Model (Version 1.0) is designed to estimate surface ' \
              'water exposure from the use of pesticide in rice paddies. It is a screening ' \
              'level model that is based on the Interim Rice Model, which has been used ' \
              'by the Environmental Fate and Effects Division for multiple years. The model ' \
              'calculates a single, screening-level concentration that represents both short ' \
              'and long term surface water exposures. The screening-level concentraion can be ' \
              'used for both aquatic ecological risk assessments and drinking water exposure ' \
              'assessments for human health risk assessment. </p>'
