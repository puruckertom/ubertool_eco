The HWBI was developed by researchers at the US EPA (Smith et al., 2013, Summers et al., 2014). The HWBI was generated
using over one hundred nationally-available data layers to assess economic, social, and ecosystem services across the
entire U.S. at the regional, state, and county levels for years 2000-2010.

Input data consisted of both
subjective and objective information and included sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and others (Smith et al, 2012).
These data were evaluated using multiple linear regression and relationship-function statistical techniques to identify
correlations and calculate coefficient values for each service. The HWBI model uses the resultant coefficients to process
22 economic, ecosystem, and social services values to calculate a total HWBI score as well as eight values for the
“domains of well-being”: Connection to Nature, Cultural Fulfillment, Education, Health, Leisure Time, Living Standards,
Safety & Security, and Social Cohesion.
