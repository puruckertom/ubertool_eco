<p>TerrPlant derives estimated exposure concentrations (EECs) of pesticide in runoff and in drift. From the derived EECs TerrPlant develops risk quotients (RQs) are developed for non-listed and listed species of monocots and dicots inhabiting dry and semi-aquatic areas adjacent to treatment sites using the equations below.</p>

<p>To calculate RQ values plant survival and growth data (EC<sub>25</sub>, NOAEC) input by the user for seedling emergence and vegetative vigor is divided into the total EEC for each scenario (total dry, total semi-aquatic, total drift) and plant type (monocot and dicot). For the non-listed species the EC<sub>25</sub> values are used and for listed species the NOAEC values are used. For spray drift RQ calculation the most sensitive measure of effect (seedling emergence or vegetative vigor) is used. </p>
