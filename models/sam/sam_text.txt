The Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) is an exposure model designed to simulate 
the magnitude, duration, and location of aquatic exposure concentrations 
of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations are estimated as a function of 
chemical properties, environmental factors, and crop/management practices.
 Outputs include pesticide exposure concentrations in a receiving water 
 body at the watershed or basin level. Concentrations also can be compared
  to user-defined toxicity thresholds in output tables, maps, and summary
  histograms to characterize the duration, frequency, and location of 
  exceedances.

SAM incorporates spatial heterogeneity of assessed drainage areas (soils, 
land cover, weather), instead of assuming a single, uniform watershed for 
high-end/protective exposures, as in previous regulatory models. 
Exposure concentrations are not limited to the standard farm pond or 
index reservoir, but represent actual water bodies within and across use 
areas. Output concentrations are aggregated at the outlet of each drainage 
basin (drinking water basin or HUC12 catchment). For ecological assessments, 
exposure estimates are based on the main channel within the HUC12. Drinking 
water exposure estimates are binned as static (lakes, reservoirs) or flowing 
(streams, rivers) water bodies.

Due to the national scale of this model, instead of routing flow from fields 
to stream channels to larger streams, flow is accumulated at the outlet 
(“pour point”)  for the catchment of interest (HUC12 or drinking water basin).
 Daily flow estimates can be compared to stream gauge measurements and daily 
 concentrations to monitoring datasets.

This is the alpha version of SAM.  Important routines including erosion, 
spray drift, irrigation, travel times beyond a “dayshed”, and the application 
window (as a function of weather and crop stage) are in development.

Many of the data inputs and the hydrology are pre-processed to make exposure
 concentration calculations at this scale possible in a reasonable amount of 
 time. Spatially, soils are grouped into classes based on important pesticide 
 transport factors, weather data has been regridded to a common grid resolution 
 (~24,000 km grids), land cover captures the prior 5 years of the Cropland 
 Data Layer, crop inputs include a range of crops from an incorporated 
 database, and the hydrology is based on NHD Plus v2 monthly mean flow dataset.

Recipe files are used to create a list of soil-crop-weather units in each
 basin and the total area of each unit to be simulated. The one-dimensional 
 solute transport routines in SAM are based on PRZM, but are structured 
 differently by separating hydrology and chemical transport to reduce 
 redundancy and increase computational speed. The approach consists of: 
 Scenario Generator, which outputs the hydrology for sub watersheds using 
 the curve number method (to estimate direct runoff and infiltration from 
 rainfall events); Super PRZM Hydro, which sums the runoff (from all soil-
 crop-weather units) to represent the total daily runoff of an entire 
 watershed; and Pesticide Transport and Water Body Concentration Calculator,
  which outputs the daily pesticide concentration in the receiving water 
  body based on the transport, degradation, and washout of the pesticide mass.
