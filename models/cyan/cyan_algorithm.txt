MERIS</a> and Sentinel-3 <a href="https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-3-olci">OLCI</a> satellite
sensors are processed using second derivative spectral shape algorithms to estimate cyanobacteria index values.</p>

The cyanobacteria detection algorithm (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425714002211">Lunetta et al. 2015</a>)
 processes reflectance with a "spectral shape" (SS) equation:

where λ indicates a wavelength and R is the amount of reflectance at that wavelength.
 For MERIS imagery, wavelengths 620, 665, 681, 709, and 754 nm are especially relevant to detect cyanobacteria and to differentiate
 cyan blooms from green algae.
 For example, an equation with spectral shape SS(681 nm), λ = 681 nm, λ+ = 709 nm, and λ− = 665 nm is centered on the
 681 nm band and covers peaks in both chlorophyll absorption and chlorophyll fluorescence.
